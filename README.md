Irssi -> HTML
=============

This tool can convert a set of Irssi log into a full HTML website that support
Url list and search index.

The format of the logs must be: irclogs/[year]/[networkname]/#[channel]-[month]-[day].log

To use it, just do:

	python irssi2html.py irclogs html

And you'll get a html directory with all the logs :)
